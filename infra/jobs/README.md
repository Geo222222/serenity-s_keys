# Automation & Jobs

- Queue: Redis-backed (Celery/RQ) or BullMQ; store definitions here.
- Scheduled jobs: weekly report generation, reminder cadence, no-show handling, waitlist sweeps.
- Operator hotkeys (Ctrl+1..M) integrate with queue to publish TTS prompts.
- Track run history + retries for compliance visibility.
